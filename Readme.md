MDC : Mapping Diagnostic Context

It works much fine with single thread but in multithreaded processing it's context is shared to other threads. 
You can find an easy solution here!

Thanks

I am looking for a solution where this task can be done using annotation or some configuration. So that adding a function in every parallelStream can be avoided. Feedbacks are most welcomed. :)
